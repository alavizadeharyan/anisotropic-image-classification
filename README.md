This project deals with classifying an image using a gradient-free method
when the standard Euclidean metric is replaced by a matrix norm.
Classifying an image in this way, which is sometimes referred to as
"anisotropic classification", has very interesting features.

Since this work is not published yet, only part of the code is exposed to
the public view in this repository. Therefore, this code does not work on
its own, and is only to provide a preview of the project.
